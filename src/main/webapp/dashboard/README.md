# Metrics Dashboard

A React web application that displays metrics from integration tests in a visual dashboard.

## Features

- Bar charts for visualizing metrics
- Table with clickable rows to switch between tests
- Option to view all tests or individual tests
- Ability to select different metrics for visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:
   ```
   cd src/main/webapp/dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized production files.

## Data Source

The dashboard reads metrics from the CSV file located at:
```
http://localhost:3000/metrics.csv
```

This file is automatically copied from the original location at:
```
/Users/robertwohl/IdeaProjects/IntegrationTesting/build/reports/metrics/metrics.csv
```

The copying is done by the `copy-metrics.sh` script, which is automatically run when you start the development server with `npm start` or build the application with `npm run build`. You can also run this script manually with:
```
npm run copy-metrics
```

This file is generated by the integration tests and contains various metrics including:
- Execution time
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Indexing metrics
- Startup metrics
- UI responsiveness metrics
